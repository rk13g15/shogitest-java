# Shogi Client

In the summer of 2017 I discovered Shogi, and decided to try and learn the game. As part of this, I tried to create a Shogi client within Java. The client is incomplete; the only thing able to be seen is a potential handicap selector before a game would begin. Additionally, the source for a Shogi engine exists within this repo. However, there is not an implementation to show it off unfortunately. 

This project was created within Eclipse. To test this code out for yourself, clone this repo into a desired folder of yours. Then, import the repo into your Eclipse workspace, via *Import...*, then *General > Existing Projects into Workspace*. From there, you should be able to run the program like any other Eclipse project.

Additionally, you can import directly from the Git clone URI within Eclipse. Right clicking on your Eclipse Project Explorer, navigating to *Import...*, then navigating to *Git > Projects from Git*, you can follow the wizard to clone this project for your own perview.
